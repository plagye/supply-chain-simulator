# Branch layout

- **main** — Current version: 10 drone products (D-101..D-303), 10 shared parts, live API, code-based routes and delivery. Use this for all new work.
- **legacy** — Previous version: single-product (DRONE-X1) simulator. Preserved for reference; not actively developed.

The former `feature/live-api-and-drone-variants` branch has been promoted to `main`. The old `main` has been renamed to `legacy` and pushed to the remote.
