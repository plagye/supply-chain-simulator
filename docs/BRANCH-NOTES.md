# Branch: feature/live-api-and-drone-variants

This branch is the **new active direction** for the supply chain simulator.

- **10 drone products** (D-101..D-303) and **10 shared parts** (P-001..P-010)
- **Minimal live API** (call and get values: inventory, status, orders, deliveries)
- **main** is deprecated for active development of this 10-drone + live-API scenario

Work here; merge to main when ready to make this the default.
